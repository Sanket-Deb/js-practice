### Q3_counter: counter

**Prompt:**  
THIS QUESTION WAS PART OF LEETCODE 30-DAYS JS CHALLENGE.

Write a function createCounter. It should accept an initial integer init. It should return an object with three functions.

The three functions are:

increment() increases the current value by 1 and then returns it.
decrement() reduces the current value by 1 and then returns it.
reset() sets the current value to init and then returns it.

**Example:**

```
Input: init = 5, calls = ["increment","reset","decrement"]
Output: [6,5,4]
```

**Approach:**  
Explain your thought process here.
